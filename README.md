## Lesson 1: Hello, World

![A Scratch program](ScratchHello.png  "Make sure to put the say in a custom block")
>The Above Scratch program will say Hi!
>
>Just Remember the Say block is part of the main custom block.

Now let's write the same thing in Python!

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Running this will result in `Hello, Wold!` being printed on the screen!
